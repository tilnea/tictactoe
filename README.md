The final goal of this take-home assessment is having a functional Tic-tac-toe game. The game should be playable by 2 players on the same computer and we recommend that you donâ€™t spend more than a couple of hours on it. The requisites are the following:

1. Written in Typescript and React
1. Commit as much as possible to show your line of thought (donâ€™t need to worry about having working parts orðŸ’©, we just want to understand how you think and how your solution evolves)
1. Have a board to play the tic tac toe game
1. See which players turn it is (you can use Placeholder indicators, For example, Player 1 / Player 2)
1. Have an indicator of which player won (Preferably animate it in) and witch line on the board is the winning line.
1. Have an indicator if it is a draw (Preferably animate it in)
1. Have a reset button to reset the game (it starts the game over)
1. Keep a score of how many times Player 1 or Player 2 won, between games (does not need to persist between page refresh)

### UI/UX:

There is no design for this, but we would like to see a decently looking tic tac toe game.  
You do not need to focus on responsive design (you can assume Laptop screens), but we would like to put emphasis on animations.

### Add test coverage:

The application should have test coverage to test that the game works correctly: (Check for a Draw, Vertical Line win, Horizontal line win, Diagonal line win) (you can use any tool for writing tests)

## Evaluation criteria

Your final solution will be evaluated accordingly to the following criteria's (in order of importance):

1.  Functional game
2.  UI/UX animations
3.  Code quality / clean code etc
4.  Test coverage

## How to submit

After your solution is ready you can open a pull request to this same repository. Our team will review and write a few comments/requests (like a real-life PR)
